## General
Apache Archivaâ„¢ is an extensible repository management software that helps taking care of your own personal or enterprise-wide build artifact repository. It is the perfect companion for build tools such as Maven, Continuum, and ANT.<br /> 
Apache [offers](https://archiva.apache.org/download.cgi) standalone binaries for several operating systems, but not for ARM architecture. Besides binaries Apache provides also Web Application Archive (WAR) files that can be used in Java-Servlet applications.<br />
Since Spring Boot brings its own Tomcat server, it is easier to run and to configure. Unfortunately there are only a few entries when you try to search how to get a war file running with Spring Boot. Most tutorials shows, how to convert a Spring Boot application to war.<br />
This repository contains a minimal setup with Spring Boot that needs at least one argument that points to the local stored Apache Archiva war file and Archiva needs also two environment arguments that points to a folder for Tomcat CATALINA.<br />
<br />
Sources that helped to create a running Spring Boot application with an external war file:
- [How to deploy war files to Spring Boot Embedded Tomcat](https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/spring-boot-add-war-to-embedded-tomcat/)
- [The Build Artifact Repository Manager](https://archiva.apache.org/index.html)

## Requirements
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8
- Apache Archiva war file (tested with version [2.2.10](http://www.apache.org/dist/archiva/2.2.10/binaries/apache-archiva-2.2.10.war)).
- Maven
- Git (optional)

## How to build
### Docker image
See [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) or [Dockerfile-alpine](./Dockerfile-alpine)
Note: The Apache Archiva WAR file must be in the root folder and called webapp.war

### Local installation
- Download or build the newest Apache Archiva WAR file (tested with version [2.2.10](http://www.apache.org/dist/archiva/2.2.10/binaries/apache-archiva-2.2.10.war))
- Run `mvn verify -Dapache-archiva.configuration.path=/path/to/apache-archiva.war/file` or `mvn package` (skips test)
- The Spring Boot jar file can be found under `target/apache-archiva-spring-boot-<version>.jar`
- Run the application (See next section)

## How to start
The application must be started with the following parameters:

```
spring.profiles.active
apache-archiva.configuration.path
```

and the following environment variables

```
appserver.base
appserver.home
```

Example:

```
java -Dappserver.base=<path/to/base|home> -Dappserver.home=<path/to/base|home> -jar apache-archiva-spring-boot-<version>.jar --spring.profiles.active=<local|prod> --apache-archiva.configuration.path=<path/to/archiva/webapp>
```

Additional example can be found in the [run.sh](./run.sh) script

### Optional parameters

```
apache-archiva.configuration.db.url
```

Examples:

Storing database to disk
```
apache-archiva.configuration.db.url=jdbc:derby:directory:<path/to/database/for/users>;create=true
```

In memory database
```
apache-archiva.configuration.db.url=jdbc:derby:memory:users;create=true
```
